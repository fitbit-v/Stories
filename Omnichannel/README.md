## Skills-Based Routing
Skills-based routing uses Apex action classes to assign skills, priority, and the routing model to work items.
When Omni-Channel receves a new work item, it looks at the required skills, the workâ€™s priority, and the routing model (Least Active or Most Available) to determine how to route the work.
### Set Up Skills-Based Routing
#### 1. Identify Which Skills Agents Need
To set up skills-based routing, you need a list of the skills that agents must have to resolve different work items.
