In response to last week’s fraud bot, Commerce is implementing Google’s reCAPTCHA functionality in the purchase process, as Stripe recommended. This feature is being released this morning, will be invisible to cart users, and does not impact the UI in any way. 
 
A big thank-you to the Fraud Squad, Security, and Commerce engineering teams
