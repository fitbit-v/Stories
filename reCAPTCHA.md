In response to last week’s fraud bot, Commerce is implementing Google’s reCAPTCHA functionality in the purchase process, as Stripe recommended. This feature is being released this morning, will be invisible to cart users, and does not impact the UI in any way. You can read more about the feature here.
 
A big thank-you to the Fraud Squad, Security, and Commerce engineering teams for swarming on this issue so quickly – great work everyone!
 
Please reach out if you have any questions.
 
Best,
Kate
