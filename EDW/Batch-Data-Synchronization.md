# Batch Data Synchronization
## Context
Extract customer activity information from Salesforce and import it into an on-premises data warehouse on an ongoing basis.
## Problem
How do you import data into Salesforce and export data out of Salesforce, taking into consideration that these imports and exports can interfere with end-user operations during business hours, and involve large amounts of data?
